Glossary:
* Chain: A tree of blocks. During normal operation, this tree is constantly being pruned by the finalization process into a single chain.
* Block: The basic unit of the chain. Contains zero or more transactions of different kinds.
* Best branch/chain: The branch in the block tree that contains the most blocks (and all finalized blocks).
* Node: A process running the P2P software.
* Peer: A peer of a node is another node connected to it.
* Transaction: A piece of information stored in a block on the chain. Can be CCD transfer, module or account deployment, etc.
* Consensus: Agreement on how blocks are generated and when they're valid and finalized.
* Account: Accounts represent external users of the chain and are the ones who always initiate non-consensus related actions, i.e., sending transactions.
* Reward account: Special account for bakers and finalizers that have some ability to change the parameters (e.g. keys) of the baker.
* Account: An entity holding CCDs. Bakers, contracts, and other stakeholders have accounts.
* Module: An Acorn module that defines zero or more smart contracts.
* Instance: An instance of a smart contract. Smart contracts may hold CCDs.
* Birk parameters: "lottery" state.
* Skov: The tree layer which stores all the consensus information, e.g., which blocks exist, which are final etc.
* Branch/parent/ancestor/child: Refers to relation between blocks as nodes in a tree in the usual way.
* Baker: Producer of new blocks.
* Subscription: ?
* TPS: ?
