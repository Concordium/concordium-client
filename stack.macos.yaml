# NB: When updating the resolver to one that uses ghc 8.10.5 or higher also
# remove the compiler override below.
resolver: lts-17.4

# At present (Mar 14 2022) we are using a stack resolver with ghc 8.10.4 as the
# default compiler. However we are unable to use this version of GHC because 
# it does not exist in macOS with M1 chip. For this reason we override
# the compiler version here. Once we update the stack resolver this should not
# be necessary anymore.
compiler: ghc-8.10.5
